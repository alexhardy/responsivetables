Let’s face it, tables are boring and they’re not exactly best friends with [Responsive Web Design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/ "Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte, on A List Apart"). This is an implementation of responsive tables that I’ve refined over a few projects, and I hope it will be useful.
